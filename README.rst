Set up dependencies and run test code
#####################################

To run the code, use a virtual environment and run the test as follows:

.. code-block:: bash

  # Create new conda python environment.
  conda create -n purpliance_oss python=3.8
  conda activate purpliance_oss

  # Install the current package.
  pip install -e .
  pip install -r requirements.txt

  # Test: Extract privacy statements from each file in test/policies and output
  # as json files in test/policies/stmt.
  bash test/test.sh

  # Extract privacy statements from each file in the $INPUT_DIR
  # json files in $INPUT_DIR/stmt.
  # INPUT_DIR contains plain sentencized text files *.txt to be analyzed.
  # Each non-blank line in the file should contain one and only 1 sentence.
